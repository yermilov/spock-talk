== About Me

I have 5 year experience working in the Java world starting from Intern in EPAM Systems to Senior Software Engineer today in the same company.
Most of this time I've worked in Big Data area, developing various extensions for Hadoop-family tools. Almost accidentally, 2 years ago I became responsible for automated testing on my project.
Out of work, I'm inspired by Groovy ecosystem and data science.

* Why try Spock?
* How to start with Spock?
* Advanced and hidden features
* What JUnit/TestNG/Mockito offers instead?
* Why use Spock?
